"""The forge half of the gate: A15, held against a live pull request.

`check.py` reads files and needs no network. This reads the forge, so it is a
separate command with a separate lifecycle — it runs when a pull request opens
or changes, and there is nothing for it to say the rest of the time.

    python .meta/check_pr.py 12          # what CI runs
    python .meta/check_pr.py --file b.md # a body on disk, for watching it fail

What a body must contain is **derived from the form**, never listed here. The
headings come out of the fence in `.meta/templates/pull-request.md`, which is
the same text GitHub renders into `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Adding a
heading to the form makes it required by that act alone; a checker with its own
copy of the list would drift from the form the first time either moved, and the
drift would show up as a check that had quietly stopped asking for something.

A15 is the one Article in this area that is mechanically checkable. A13 and A14
are not — reasoning in a commit message is a judgement about a paragraph, and no
length check reaches it. What is checkable is narrower and still worth having:
every item under *what was noticed and not done* is a link, so the pull request
cannot close over an observation that has nowhere to live afterwards.
